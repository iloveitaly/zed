# Options

Each sub-command typically has a set of command-line options that
control its behavior but also inherits shared command-line options
based on the personality of the command, e.g., whether it runs
a [query](#query), [takes input](#input), [produces output](#output),
and so forth.

The shared options are documented here while each sub-command description
documents its command-specific options.

## Global

The global options are shared by all commands and include:
* `-h` display help
* `-help` display help
* `-hidden` show hidden options
* `-version` print version and exit

## Query

The query options are available to commands that invoke the query runtime,
e.g., `super -c` and `super db -c`:

* `-aggmem` maximum memory used per aggregate function value in MiB, MB, etc
* `-c` [SuperSQL](../super-sql/intro.md) query to execute (may be used multiple times)
* `-e` stop upon input errors
* `-fusemem` maximum memory used by fuse in MiB, MB, etc
* `-I` source file containing query text (may be used multiple times)
* `-q` don't display warnings
* `-sortmem` maximum memory used by sort in MiB, MB, etc
* `-stats` display search stats on stderr

## Input

The input command-line options are available to commands that take input,
e.g., `super -c`, `super db load`:
* `-bsup.readmax` maximum Super Binary read buffer size in MiB, MB, etc.
* `-bsup.readsize` target Super Binary read buffer size in MiB, MB, etc.
* `-bsup.threads` number of Super Binary read threads
* `-bsup.validate` validate format when reading Super Binary
* `-csv.delim` CSV field delimiter
* `-e` stop upon input errors
* `-i` format of input data

## Output

The output command-line options are available to commands that produce output:
* `-B` allow Super Binary to be sent to a terminal output
* `-bsup.compress` compress Super Binary frames
* `-bsup.framethresh` minimum Super Binary frame size in uncompressed bytes (default "524288")
* `-color` enable/disable color formatting for -S and db text output
* `-f` format for output data
* `-J` shortcut for `-f json -pretty`, i.e., multi-line JSON
* `-j` shortcut for `-f json -pretty=0`, i.e., line-oriented JSON
* `-o` write data to output file
* `-pretty` tab size to pretty print JSON and Super JSON output
* `-S` shortcut for `-f sup -pretty`, i.e., multi-line SUP
* `-s` shortcut for `-f sup -pretty=0`, i.e., line-oriented SUP
* `-split split` output into one file per data type in this directory
* `-splitsize` if >0 and -split is set, split into files at least this big rather than by data type
* `-unbuffered` disable output buffering

An optional [SuperSQL](../super-sql/intro.md)
query is comprised of text specified by `-c` and source files
specified by `-I`.  Both `-c` and `-I` may appear multiple times and the
query text is concatenated in left-to-right order with intervening newlines.
Any error messages are properly collated to the included file
in which they occurred.

## Database

Database options available to the `super db` command and
to all `db` [sub-commands](db.md#sub-commands) include:
* `-configdir` configuration and credentials directory
* `-db database` location (defaults to environment variable SUPER_DB if not specified)
* `-q` quiet mode to disable displaying status messages for many `super db` subcommands

## Commit

Commit options are available to the `super db` commands that
create a commit in the database:
* `-user <text>` user name for commit message
* `-message <text>` commit message
* `-meta <value>` application metadata attached to commit
